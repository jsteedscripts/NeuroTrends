NeuroTrends is an RShiny app that uses Google trends time series data to analyze Google search interest in Neuromorphic Computing over the years. The app is live at https://juliasteed.shinyapps.io/NeuroInterest/.

I built upon NeuroTrends to add forecasting in NeuroForecast. This iteration of the app is live at https://juliasteed.shinyapps.io/NeuroForecast/.
